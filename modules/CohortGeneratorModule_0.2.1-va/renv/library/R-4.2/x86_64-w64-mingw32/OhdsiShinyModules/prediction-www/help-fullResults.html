<p>This shows the settings and results for a specific model design when model development is done in the selected database or validation of a model with the model design is done in the selected database.</p>


  <ul>
<li> Design Settings: shows the settings used for the model design - it is possible to reproduce the model development with these setting and the database. </li> 
<li> Model: shows the covariates in the model, the variable importance (value) and how often the covariate occurs for paients with and without the outcome. </li>   
<li> Threshold dependant: A plot showing the sensitivity, specificity and precision for different cut-offs.  There is also an interactive explorer. </li>   
<li> Discrimination: You can view the test/train/cross validation (or any subset) discrimiantion performance here.  Select to see the plots. </li>  
<li> Calibration: You can view the test/train/cross validation (or any subset) calibration performance here.  Select to see the plots. </li>  
<li> Net Benefit: View the net benefit performance for any subset </li>  
<li> [Not always shown] Validation: If exploring a model development, you will see the validation tab that lets you see any external validation performances for the model. </li>  
</ul>
