<p>This shows the different model designs that have had models developed or validated.</p>

<p>
  Each model design has a model type (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree), a target cohort (the patients the model is developed to be applied to), an outcome (what is being predicted) and a TAR (time-at-risk when the outcome is being predicted).  The AUROC summaries give the min/mean/max performance for the model design across multiple databases.  The number of databases tell you how many different databases there are where the model design was diagnosed, developed or validated.
